Description: # WhatsFly
        ## Just run and have fun. Just try and go fly. 
        
        ### *current version 0.0.1 works in linux 32bit only*
        
        WhatsApp web wrapper in Python. No selenium or gecko web driver needed. 
        
        setting up browser driver are tricky for python newcomers, and thus it makes your code soo laggy.
        
        i knew that feeling. it was painful.
        
        powered by Whatsmeow --a golang based WhatsApp library-- 'hopefully' will make this wrapper easy to use without sacrificing the speed and perfomance.
        
        Thanks to Whatsmeow for amazing works. Inspired from tls-client, tiktoken, and whatsmeow.
