# Celery-ai
Multiplatform OpenAI keyboard integration

# Description

This is a simple tool that integrates OpenAI ChatGPT and Davinci models by hooking the PC keyboard. It works on Linux, Mac and Windows.
It requires a OpenAI api Key, you can obtain a free evaluation Key from OpenAI by registering and then going to the user settings (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Installation

1. pip install celery-ai

## Usage

1. Run the application: `celery-ai`
2. press the <Alt>+i key combination in any window or shell. Celery-ai is now recording the prompt. Type your query and press `esc` or `enter` to finalize. Celery-ai will delete the query and replace it with the answer from the selected OpenAI model. Example: <Alt>+i How are you doing? <esc> 

## Example prompts:
* 'find all files starting with letter z, in subdirectories, linux command'
* 'youtube video of python tutorial'
* 'write an example description of a github project in markup language'

Warning: The AI will sometimes write commands and execute them if you query it inside a terminal.
