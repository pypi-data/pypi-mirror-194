## Synopsis

This library provides a simple python interface to 
NASA's [Heliophysics Data Portal](https://heliophysicdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
(HDP).  This library implements the client side of the 
[HDP RESTful web services](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/).
For more general details about the HDP web services, see
https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/.

## Code Example

This package contains example code calling most of the available web services.
To run the included example, do the following

    python -m hdpws

---

This 
[Jupyter notebook](https://heliophysics.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/jupyter/HdpWsExample.html) 
page contains an example to help someone begin using the hdpws library to 
access information from the 
[Heliophysics Data Portal](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/) in a Python program.

---

Also, the following [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) demonstrate
different features of the library:
1. [Simple Query Example](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/jupyter/HdpWsExample.html) ([ipynb file](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/jupyter/HdpWsExample.ipynb))demonstrating a simple query.

These notebooks are also available on 
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/berniegsfc/hdpws-notebooks/main).

## Motivation

This library hides the HTTP and JSON/XML details of the HDP web 
services. A python developer only has to deal with python objects and 
methods.

## Dependencies

At this time, the only dependency are:
1. [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

The critical dependencies above will automatically be installed when this 
library is.

## Installation

To install this package

    $ pip install -U hdpws

## API Reference

Refer to
[hdpws package API reference](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/py/hdpws/index.html)

or use the standard python help mechanism.

    from hdpws import HdpWs
    help(HdpWs)

## Tests

The tests directory contains 
[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
tests.
