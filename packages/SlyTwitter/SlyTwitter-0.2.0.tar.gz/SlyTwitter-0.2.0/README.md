<!-- elevator begin -->

> 🚧 **This library is an early work in progress! Breaking changes may be frequent.**

## No-boilerplate, *async* and *typed* Twitter access. 😋

```shell
pip install slytwitter
```

This library does not have full coverage.
Premium version 1.1 is not supported.
Currently, the following topics are supported:

* Posting and managing tweets, with media
* Reading followers

V2 may or may not work, due to changes in access policy to Twitter's API. If it is, the following topics are supported:

* Reading followers and following
* Getting users

You can directly grant user tokens using the command line, covering the whole OAuth 1.0 grant process.

Example usage:

```python
import asyncio
from SlyTwitter import *

async def main():

    auth = OAuth1('test/app.json', 'test/user.json')
    twitter = Twitter(auth)

    tweet = await twitter.tweet('Hello, world!')
    follow = await twitter.check_follow('dunkyl_', 'TechConnectify')

    print(tweet)
    print(follow) # @dunkyl_ follows @TechConnectify
    
asyncio.run(main())
```
