    """A timeseries is an append only sequence-like timeseries data structure.
    
    Internally, `Timeseries` is made up of doubly linked lists of fixed length
    chunks representing a sequence of sample tuples (timestamp, value).
    
    A `Timeseries` is uniquely identified by its subscription.
    
    A timeseries is always monotonically increasing, you cannot add a sample
    where the timestamp of the sample is less than the maximum timestamp in the
    series.
    
    Outdated chunks are evicted from the series according to the retention
    period. The minimum retained timestamp is calculated against the maximum
    timestamp in the series. If a chunks last timestamp is less than the minumum
    retained timestamp, that chunk is evicted from the series.
    
    You cannot mutate a timeseries while iterating over it.
    
    Timeseries are thread safe.
