### ❖ Information 
  
  DrexelFetch is an incredibly simple tool to fetch information about Drexel Courses. 

  *NOTE* that the data is sourced directly from the `courses.csv` file in the top level repo, and might be outdated in the future. The data was scraped and sanitized by [@Shahriyar](https://github.com/ShahriyarShawon), I just wrote a silly little python script on top to display it. 

  The tool was originally meant for personal use only and doesn't follow any "good" code practices. I make no guarantees about the correctness, error checking or the aesthetics of the code.

  We ball regardless.
