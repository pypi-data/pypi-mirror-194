Stag (abbreviation from "static generator") is a lightweight, customizable
and easily extensible generator of static web pages. It is format-agnostic,
but comes bundled with support for Markdown input files.

This manual focuses on end-user part of it.

== Overview

Stag generates pages and documents from the set of source files. It's
primarily used to generate web pages from some kind of lightweight markup
files (e.g. Markdown, Asciidoc), with the help of a set of templates, but it
isn't limited to that. For simplicity, however, we'll assume in this Manual
that Stag is used to generate a website.

Stag is configured with _config.toml_ file, which is placed in the root
directory of your project. Typically, Stag's input resides inside the
_content_ directory and the output is generated to the __output_ directory.

Stag intends to be simple to use and understand. It removes many _magical_
parts of other static generators have, being more explicit instead about what
it does.

== Creating the First Page

Let's start with a simple one-page website, which we'll build upon.

=== Installing Stag

Before we even start, Stag must be installed on the system. Stag is released
to the https://pypi.org/project/stag-ssg[PyPI], so it's easy to install
it with pip, or tools like pipx:

----
$ pip install --user stag-ssg
----

Optionally, you can clone its repository and install it from there:

----
$ git clone "https://git.goral.net.pl/stag.git"
$ pip install --user ./stag
----

=== Initializing Stag Page

To quickly generate all the necessary files, run:

----
$ stag init
----

Stag will ask you some questions, like the title of your page or language in
which you intend to write.

NOTE: `stag init` can be run non-interactively, by passing all the required
parameters on the command line.

Your newly initialized Stag project has the following items:

config.toml:: Configuration file.
content:: Directory where the sources of your website reside.
themes/default:: A default theme (templates) for your website.

=== Test run

Once you familiar yourself, it's time to test-run Stag. To do that, enter the
to your projects root and run `stag build`:

----
$ cd stag
$ stag build
----

Once run, Stag creates a new directory, __output_, in which it stores the
whole generated webpage. To view it, point your web browser to the index.html
file.

Stag also offers a built-in HTTP server, which serves the content of built
website on _localhost:8000_. To start it, run `stag serve`. In this mode Stag
automatically detects when files are modified and regenerates the website as
necessary, which makes it great for example for writing articles, constantly
verifying how they look.

== Plugins

Almost every part of stag is a plugin. Plugins are invoked on certain events
which occur during site generation (e.g. when stag finds a new file, when it
starts processing input files etc.)

You can easily add custom plugins. Stag reads their path from the
`pluginspath` setting in config.toml. By default it is _plugins_ directory
relative to the root directory of the project. You can read more about it in
xref:plugins.adoc#[Plugins Programmer Manual].

=== Disabling Plugins

To disable a certain plugin, put int in `plugins_disabled` list in
_config.toml_. Plugins are named after their file names, without an
extension. For example:

.config.toml
----
plugins_disabled = ["md", "macros"]
----

=== Additional Dependencies

If your plugin needs some additional dependencies, they must be installed
separately. If Stag is installed in virtualenv, they should be installed to
that virtualenv, for example:

----
$ path/to/venv/pip3 install <dependency>
----

or with a tool like pipx:

----
$ pipx inject stag-ssg <dependency>
----

== Built-in plugins


=== markdown (md)

Markdown plugin reads Markdown files, which can have optional front matter
with metadata, which is also saved by the reader. Front matter is expected to
be in TOML format, delimited with `+++` (3 plus signs) from the top and
bottom.

.Example Markdown file with front matter
----
+++
title = "My First Stag Page!"
date = 2021-09-02
lastmod = 2021-10-01
tags = ["site", "something else"]
+++
This was a **triumph**!
----

Markdown generator takes input provided by the Markdown reader and generates
HTML data from it. It uses {url-python-markdown}[Python Markdown] package.
Its extensions are enabled through `plugins.markdown.extensions` list.

Configuration is stored inside `plugins.markdown` table in config.toml.

.Example markdown configuration
----
[plugins.markdown]
extensions = ["sane_list", "smarty", "footnotes"]
----

=== macros

Macros provides input postprocessing. Thanks to it you can use Jinja macros
inside input files (e.g. in Markdown). It enables a system which resembles
"shortcodes" known from other static site generators.

To enable macros you must configure path to the directory which contains
Jinja templates with macros definitions. Macros use `[plugins.macros]` table
in config.toml to do that.

.Example macros configuration
----
[plugins.macros]
path = "directory/with/macros"
----

.Example of file which use a macro
----
+++
title = "My Page"
++++

{% from "macros.html" import mymacro %}

Ordinary content {{ mymacro(foo="bar") }} rest of ordinary content.
----

=== taxonomies

Taxonomies are automatically generated collections of pages (e.g. tags or
categories). They must be enabled in config.toml and are generated from
metadata of content files.

.Enabling 2 taxonomies in config.toml
----
[[taxonomies]]
key = "tags"
singular = "tag"
plural = "tags"

[[taxonomies]]
key = "category"
plural = "categories"
----

Once defined, stag scans metadata of files and groups files which have the same
metadata:

.Setting terms of taxonomy on a page
----
tags = ["foo", "bar"]
category = "my category"
----

Each taxonomy generates a taxonomy landing page and a list of term pages.
(think of _tags/foo_, _tags/bar_ etc.):

Taxonomy Landing Page:::
  it contains data regarding taxonomy itself and a list of term pages, which
  can be accessed from `page.taxonomy.terms`.
Term Pages:::
  each of them contains a list of ordinary pages, which belong to the term
  (e.g. which have a specific tag); they can be accessed from
  `page.term.pages`. Additionaly they have `metadata['taxonomy']` set with a
  name of parent taxonomy.

==== Rendering taxonomies

Taxonomies are rendered like the ordinary pages (see
xref:_template_type_deduction[Template type deduction], but they use
different default templates. Landing taxonomy pages use *taxonomy* template
(e.g. _taxonomy.html_) and term pages use *term* template
(e.g. _term.html_). This can be customised in two ways:

. Default templates for all taxonomy/term pages can be changed in
  `[template.templates]` section.
+
.Setting different default templates for taxonomy page and terms pages
----
[template.templates]
taxonomy = "mytaxonomy"
list = "mylist"
----
. If stag finds a file which would result with the same URL as taxonomy or
  term page, it incorporates it instead of throwing a usual error:
.. Metadata of the file is preserved, but missing entries necessary for
   taxonomies are created: this can be used to pass custom metadata to Jinja
   and template. For example `type` can be explicitly set, which will result
   in choosing a different template.
.. File content is preserved.
.. page lists and taxonomy data is added to the `page` object and overrides
   any previous entries.
+
====
For example, to add a metadata to the "tags" taxomony, create a file
_tags.md_ or _tags/index.md_ inside your content, with the following content:

.Page for taxonomy landing page (tags.md)
----
++++
title = "List of tags"
mymetadata = "My Metadata"
----

.Page for a single tag (tags/mytag.md)
----
title = "Special case of mytag"
mytagmetadata = "special metadata"
----
====

== Templates

Stag uses {url-jinja-templates}[Jinja Template Engine] to create files from
the output produced by generators.

It is configured in `[template]` table. Most important setting is _name_,
which is a path to the directory from which templates will be read. Other
important sub-table is `[template.templates]`, which contains settings
for default templates used for certain types of pages.

=== Template Name Deduction

To produce a page, Stag needs to know which template should be used from the
available ones. Typically, types of pages are:

* _page_ for ordinary page;
* _index_ for start pages;
* _taxonomy_ for pages which hold a list of taxonomy terms;
* _list_ for pages which hold a list of other pages.

The following procedure is used to determine pages' type:

. if page sets its `metadata.type` field, it is used as a type,
. otherwise, if page is a taxonomy page, its type will be set to
  `template.templates.taxonomy` (by default: _taxonomy_),
. otherwise, if page is a list page, its type will be set to
  `template.templates.list` (by default: _list_),
. otherwise, page's type wyll be set to `template.templates.page` (by
  default: _page_).

To produce the full name of the template, page type will be then combined
with the output type (usually an extension typical for the kind of output
produced by the generator plugin, e.g. _html_ or _xml_).

There might be a situation when deduced template isn't available. In such
case, Stag provides a very basic built-in template and informs users about
the situation with appropriate error prints.

.Template deduction with user-defined type
====
Suppose the following Markdown page:

----
+++
title = ""
type = "mypage"
+++
----

This page will use _mypage.html_ template, because the output of Markdown
rendering is html file and the type selected by the user for this page is
"mypage".
====

.Template deduction without user-defined type
====
Consider the following Markdown page:

----
+++
title = ""
+++
----

Here theme must deduce the name, because there's no one provided by the user.
It is an ordinary page, so it will be taken from
`template.templates.page`. If this setting wasn't changed, the template
which will be rendered from _page.html_.
====

.Name clash?
====
Consider the following Markdown page:

----
+++
title = ""
type = "taxonomy"
+++
----

and the following configuration:

----
[template.templates]
taxonomy = "somethingelse"
----

The output page will be rendered from _taxonomy.html_, *not* from
_somethingelse.html_, because the _type_ keyword in metadata directly maps to
the name of the used template, not to the default value from config.toml.
====

== Cache

Generating sites with a lot of web pages and a lot of plugins can sometimes
become slow. To fight this, Stag caches the results of page generation and
uses them when it detects that source pages haven't changed since last run.

You can disable this behaviour and force full rebuilds by passing
`--no-cache` option to _build_ and _serve_ commands. You can also make it
persistent by placing `no_cache = true` in _config.toml_.

The default directory used for cache is a hidden _.cache_ directory placed in
your site's root. You can change it by changing `cache` parameter in
_config.toml_, for example:

.config.toml
----
cache = "~/.cache/mysite"
----

NOTE: Because almost everything in Stag is a plugin, caching is the most
efficient if you use plugins which are aware of it. All built-in plugins use
cached results whenever it's possible. To learn how to make your plugins
cache-friendly, refer to xref:plugins.adoc#[Plugins Programmer Manual].
