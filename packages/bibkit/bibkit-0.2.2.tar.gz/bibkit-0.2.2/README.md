# bibkit
`bibkit` aims to be a toolkit for working with library metadata. It is still very young project and I develop it in my free time to learn about proper development of Python libraries and open source project maintainership. A more specific information and documentation will follow soon.

I'll try to have a significant test coverage and in the near future I'll start testing against all supported Python versions ([https://devguide.python.org/versions/#versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#versions)). I skipped 3.7 because it won't be supported anymore in a few months. Unsupported Python versions will be dropped as soon as possible.

## Installation
To install `bibkit` run `pip install bibkit`.
