    The `RunningObjectName` class consists of the following elements:

    - The domain name `"WebSphere"`.
    - Several key properties, for example:
        - `name` represents the display name of the particular object, for example, `MyServer`.
        - `type` indicates the type of object that is accessible through the MBean, for example, `ApplicationServer`, and EJBContainer.
        - `cell` represents the name of the cell on which the object runs.
        - `node` represents the name of the node on which the object runs.
        - `process` represents the name of the server process in which the object runs.
        - `mbeanIdentifier` correlates the MBean instance with corresponding configuration data.

    For more information, see Object name, Attribute, Attribute list.
    
    You can use the asterisk (`*`) at the end as a **wildcard character**, so that you do not have to specify the entire set of key properties.

    Note:
        The only difference between a `template` and an `object name` is that the template can be partial and use wildcards.
        It can then be used to retrieve a complete Object Name.

    Example:
        ```
        'WebSphere:name="My Server",type=ApplicationServer,node=n1,*'
