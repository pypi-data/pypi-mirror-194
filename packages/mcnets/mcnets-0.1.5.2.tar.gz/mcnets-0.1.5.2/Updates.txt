- 

<To Do>
- Implement ways to use the net as a backbone of a different type of NN
	- Classifiers (using e^-x prob. calc.s)
	- Curve fitting (using output as slopes)


0.1.5 Status
<New>
- For nets with inSize = 1, a simple number can be given (no longer required to be that stupid 1x1 numpy array thing).
- Reduced maxCycles default value to 5 for the cycle training
- A float value can be given in .Calculate if inSize == 1

<To Do>
- Implement output as slope behavior for curve-fitting, it is incredibly much more accurate and efficient (like 5% of the work to do for much better results).
	- First add RELU/ELU stuff as part of the net
	- Could also just add as a derivative finder for now

- Operational as package
- Printing an AdvNet now also prints the # of parameters it has
