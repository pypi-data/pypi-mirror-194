## What is GAM Coach?

GAM Coach is an interactive tool that helps **everyday users** *understand* and *alter* machine learning models' decisions.
It shows users diverse ways to change their input data so that they can get a different output from the model, and it allows users to customize these suggestions through a few clicks!
For example, if a user wants to get approved for a loan, GAM Coach may suggest they increase their credit score.
If the user finds it difficult to increase their credit score, GAM Coach will search for alternative strategies, such as lowering the loan amount.

## Live Demo

For a live demo, visit: <https://poloclub.github.io/gam-coach/>

## Running Locally

Clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:poloclub/gam-coach.git

# use --depth if you don't want to download the whole commit history
git clone --depth 1 poloclub/gam-coach.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd gamcoach-ui
npm install
```

Then run GAM Coach:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5005](https://localhost:5005). You should see GAM Coach running in your browser :)

## Use the Python Library

You can also use GAM Coach as a Python library to generate customizable counterfactual examples for generalized additive models (GAMs). You can install GAM Coach through `pip`.

Then, you only need one function call to generate customizable counterfactual examples for your GAM models!

```python
import gamcoach as coach

# First create a GAM Coach object
# It requires to provide the training data, so it can generate better CFs based
# on the data distribution
my_coach = coach.GAMCoach(ebm, x_train)

cfs = my_coach.generate_cfs(
    cur_example,
    total_cfs=3,
    # List of features that the CFs can change
    features_to_vary=['loan_amnt', 'term', 'emp_length', 'home_ownership',
                      'annual_inc', 'purpose', 'dti', 'open_acc', 'revol_bal',
                      'revol_util', 'total_acc', 'application_type', 'mort_acc',
                      'fico_score'],
    # Some continuous features need to have integer values in practice
    continuous_integer_features=['open_acc', 'total_acc', 'mort_acc', 'fico_score']
)
```

For more details and examples, read our [documentation](https://poloclub.github.io/gam-coach/docs/gamcoach).

```bash
pip install gamcoach
```

## Set Up Your Own GAM Coach

In the [demo page](https://poloclub.github.io/gam-coach), we provide five demos with the most commonly used datasets in the algorithmic recourse literature. You can easily set up a GAM Coach for your own GAM model (with only one function call). See this [documentation page](https://poloclub.github.io/gam-coach/docs/gamcoach/gamcoach.html#get_model_data) for details.
