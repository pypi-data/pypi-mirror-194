# AUTO INITIALIZATION

This module offers a class decorator, which allows initializing the variables passed to the constructor of a class when instantiating its objects.

so you have to do it manually. on the other hand you can pass a list of variables to the decorator so that it only allows those variables to be initialized. as well as passing a dictionary as an argument, which as a key will have the name of the method you want to add and as content of the key, a function that will be the method itself.
