    2. Provides a system whereby "migration scripts" may be constructed; each script
    indicates a particular series of steps that can "upgrade" a target database to a
    new version, and optionally a series of steps that can "downgrade" similarly,
    doing the same steps in reverse.
    3. Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.

    The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way beyond existing mechanisms
    such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators preserve introspectability, signatures,
    type checking abilities etc. The decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in
    far more scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent behaviour.
  wsgi-intercept: |-
    Testing a WSGI application sometimes involves starting a server at a
    local host and port, then pointing your test code to that address.

    combination and redirect them into a `WSGI application`_ importable by
    your test program. Thus, you can avoid spawning multiple processes or
    threads to test your Web app.

  typing-extensions: |-
    Typing Extensions - Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python.
    The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5, but many new features have been added to the module since then.
    This means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable to upgrade will not be able to take advantage of new types added to the typing
    module, such as typing.Protocol or typing.TypedDict.
    The typing_extensions module contains backports of these changes. Experimental types that will eventually be added to the typing
    module are also included in typing_extensions, such as typing.ParamSpec and typing.TypeGuard.

    3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under

    virtualenv for its ease of upgrading (via pip), unified handling of different
    Python versions and some more advanced features.

    be obtained. Undesirable or unexpected runtime behavior like memory bloat and
    other "pymples" can easily be identified.Pympler integrates three previously
    separate projects into a single, comprehensive profiling tool. Asizeof provides
    basic size information for one or several Python objects, muppy is used for on-
    line monitoring of a Python application and the class tracker provides off-line
    analysis of the lifetime of selected Python objects.

    are transferred to managed machines automatically.
  python-scrypt: |-
    Scrypt is useful when encrypting password as it is possible to specify a
    minimum amount of time to use when encrypting and decrypting. If, for example,
    a password takes 0.05 seconds to verify, a user won’t notice the slight delay
    when signing in, but doing a brute force search of several billion passwords
    will take a considerable amount of time. This is in contrast to more traditional
    hash functions such as MD5 or the SHA family which can be implemented extremely
    fast on cheap hardware.
  lz4: |-
    LZ4 Bindings for Python
  breathe: |-
    Breathe is an extension to reStructuredText and Sphinx to be able to read and
    render Doxygen xml output.
  dib-utils: |-
    These tools were originally part of the diskimage-builder project, but they
    have uses outside of that project as well. Because disk space is at a premium
    in base cloud images, pulling in all of diskimage-builder and its dependencies
    just to use something like dib-run-parts is not desirable. This project allows
    consumers to use the tools while pulling in only one small package with few/no
    additional dependencies.
  unicodecsv: |-
    The unicodecsv is a drop-in replacement for Python 2.7’s csv module which
    supports unicode strings without a hassle. Supported versions are python 2.7,
