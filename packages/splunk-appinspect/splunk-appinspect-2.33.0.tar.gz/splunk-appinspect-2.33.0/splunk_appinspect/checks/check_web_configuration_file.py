### Web.conf File Standards

Ensure that `web.conf` is safe for cloud deployment and that any exposed
patterns match endpoints defined by the app - apps should not expose endpoints
other than their own.

Including `web.conf` can have adverse impacts for cloud. Allow only
`[endpoint:*]` and `[expose:*]` stanzas, with expose only containing pattern=
and methods= properties.
