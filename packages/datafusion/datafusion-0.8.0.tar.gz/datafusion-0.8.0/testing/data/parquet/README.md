# Parquet Test Files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ARROW-17100.parquet | Parquet file written by PyArrow 2.0 with DataPageV2 and compressed columns. Prior to PyArrow 3.0, pages were compressed even if the is_compressed flag was 0. This was fixed in ARROW-10353, but for backwards compatibility readers may wish to support such a file. |
