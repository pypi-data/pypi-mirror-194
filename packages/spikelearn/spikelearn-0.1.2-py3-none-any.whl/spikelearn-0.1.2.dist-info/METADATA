# Spikelearn

Implementation of spiking neural networks capable of online learning tailored
for machine learning workflows and neuromorphic computing applications.


## Motivation

We needed a SNN model with the following requirements:

- Capable of handling traditional ML workflows
- Heterogeneous, with the ability to integrate both mathematical models and
  neurons or synapses inspired on neuromorphic computing and emergent devices
- That could be easily parametrizable, in order to explore a large number of
  configurations in high performance computing environments.
- That could reproduce models in existing neuromorphic chips such as Loihi.
- That could handle neuromodulators and other neuroscience-inspired goodies.
- That could be easily extensible.
- That is capable of online learning through a variety of synaptic plasticity
  rules.


Spikelearn intends to fill that role.


## Status

Spikelearn is still in development. Please check spikelearn's
documentation in [readthedocs](https://anl-spikelearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


## Quick install

Through pypi:

```
pip install spikelearn
```

## Usage

```
from spikelearn import SpikingNet, SpikingLayer, StaticSynapse
import numpy as np

snn = SpikingNet()
sl = SpikingLayer(10, 4)
syn = StaticSynapse(10, 10, np.random.random((10,10)))

snn.add_input("input1")
snn.add_layer(sl, "l1")
snn.add_synapse("l1", syn, "input1")
snn.add_output("l1")

u = 2*np.random.random(10)
for i in range(10):
    s = snn(2*np.random.random(10))
    print(s)
```
