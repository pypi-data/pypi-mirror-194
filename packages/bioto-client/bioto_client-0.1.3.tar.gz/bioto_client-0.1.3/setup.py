Otherwise the first step can be skipped.\n\n```bash\n\n# Call the client with the `user` command to assert a valid session\n% bioto-client user\n\nLoading session\n\nNot logged in, please take the following steps:\n\n1. On your computer or mobile device navigate to: https://biotoco.eu.auth0.com/activate?user_code=NEWT-OKEN\n2. Enter the following code:  NEWT-OKEN\n\nSuccesfully logged in.\n\nBioto CLI client\nSession token ***5OFd09w\n```\n\n> **Tip** Use `bioto-client --help` to see other available commands\n\n## Improve the client\n\nIf you want to improve the client or add something which you think is missing to\nthe project you can either [open an issue][1] or develop the feature yourself\nand open [a pull request with your changes][2].\n\nTo get started clone this project and create a branch. Now fix the bug or create\nthe feature you want and write some tests for it to prove it works. This can be\ndone by executing:\n\n```bash\n% make check\n```\n\n> **Note** This will run both tests and linters, use `make test` when you\'re in\n`red - green - refactor` mode\n\nWhen the checks are all passing, please open a [PR][2]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/wearebioto/PyClient/issues\n[2]: https://github.com/wearebioto/PyClient/pulls\n[3]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\n[4]: https://python-poetry.org/docs/\n',
