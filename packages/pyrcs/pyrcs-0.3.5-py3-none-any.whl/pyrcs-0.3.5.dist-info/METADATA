PyRCS is an open-source Python package for collecting and handling various codes (used in different UK rail industry systems), which are made available from the `Railway Codes`_ website. This tool is intended for those people, such as researchers and practitioners, that currently either use that website or work with the UK's railway codes and who are interested in using the Python programming language to facilitate access to, and manipulation of, data relating to railway codes.

The `installation <https://pyrcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ of PyRCS includes a set of pre-packed data. When users request data of a category that is specified on the `Railway Codes`_ website, the pre-packed data of the category is loaded by default. Beyond that, it also offers capabilities to directly access the most up-to-date data on the data source website, and update the relevant pre-packed data as well.
