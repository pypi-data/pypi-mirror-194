name: Setup Anaconda and install parcels
description: > 
  In-repo composite action to setup Anaconda and install parcels. Installation of parcels relies on
  `setup.py` file being available in the root. For general setup of Anaconda environments, just use
  the `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda` action (setting C variables as required)
