# bdvr, an Customized Blackduck_Vulnerability_report

# Use case:

Project stakeholders want to know which files are affected with vulnerabilities after a Blackduck HUB scan.

# Drawbacks:

The current blackduck generates multiple reports. To fulfill above requirement once has to refer 2 different reports to really able to trace the source files affected.

# Features

1. Produces customized report where we can see vulnerability, OSS name, affected source path details all in one report
2. Color coded

   low risk = no color

   medium risk = Yellow

   High risk = Red

3. Omits all other files which has no vulnerabilities.

### Prerequiites:

Go to Your Blackduck Project > Generate 'Create Version detail report' > checkbox Source and Vulnerabilities checked.

pip install bdvr
