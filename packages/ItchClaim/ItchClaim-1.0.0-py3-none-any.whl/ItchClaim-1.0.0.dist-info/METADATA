Automatically claim free games from itch.io

## Install
```bash
pip install ItchClaim
```

## Usage

### One-in-all command
```bash
itchclaim --login <username> claim
```
This command logs in the user (asks for password if it's ran for the first time), refreshes the list of currently free games, and start claiming the unowned ones.

#### Logging in
If you don't have access to an interactive shell, you can provide you password via flags too.

```bash
itchclaim --login <username> --password <password> --totp <2FA code or secret>
```

## Advanced Commands

### Refresh Library
```bash
itchclaim --login <username> refresh_library
```
Allows you to refresh the locally stored list of owned games. Useful if you have claimed/purchased games since you have started using the script.

### Refresh sale cache
```bash
itchclaim refresh_sale_cache
```
Refreshes the local cache of itch.io's sales. Removes expired sales and downloads new ones. This command is automatically executed by the `claim` command.

### Download links
```bash
itchclaim [--login <username>] download_urls
```
Generate a download URL for a game. These links have an expiration date. If the game doesn't require claiming, this command can be run without logging in.
*Note: this command is unfinished and currently only works for games that are present in the local sale cache.*
