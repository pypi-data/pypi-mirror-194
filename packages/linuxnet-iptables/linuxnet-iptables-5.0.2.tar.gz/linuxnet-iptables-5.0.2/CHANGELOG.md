Change Log
==========

5.0.2 (2023-03-01)

- major version updated due to changes to the Chain class:
    * the Chain methods that were only applicable to builtin chains
      were moved to the new BuiltinChain class (which is a subclass
      of Chain)
    * the Chain.__init__() signature changed, however this does not
      affect code that only specified a chain name when creating a
      Chain instance
    * the Chain methods set_pft/clear_pft were renamed to
      _set_pft/_clear_pft
- added support for setting the policy of a builtin chain
- added support for the 'security' table
