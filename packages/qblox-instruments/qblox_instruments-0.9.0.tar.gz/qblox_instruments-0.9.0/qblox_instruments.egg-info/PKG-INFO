0.9.0 (28-02-2023)
------------------
* Added new feedback functionality to allow sequencer-to-sequencer, module-to-module and Cluster-to-Cluster feedback.
  To support this, new Q1ASM instructions are added to the instruction set. The wait_trigger instruction is also
  changed accordingly with a new address argument.
* The external trigger input is now also connected to the new trigger network for feedback purposes and must be mapped
  to this network using the associated parameters.
* QCoDeS parameter name change: discretization_threshold_acq -> thresholded_acq_threshold
* QCoDeS parameter name change: phase_rotation_acq -> thresholded_acq_rotation
* Improved performance of the get_acquisitions method.
* Fixed ability to exclude sequencer.sequence readout when creating a snapshot through QCoDeS.

  value before doing a current/voltage set operation.
* Changed assembler character limit, and add code to strip the sequencer program from comments and unused information.

  voltages/currents on initialization and adding checks to prevent the user to set a value outside of the currently
  set span.

0.6.0 (29-03-2022)
------------------

This release introduces a significant refactor to Qblox Instruments as both a general restructure is introduced
and the preliminary Cluster driver is replaced by the definitive driver. Unfortunately, this means that this
release also introduces a few breaking changes. In exchange, we believe that this release prepares Qblox Instruments
for the future.

* Renamed all classes to be compliant with PEP8's capswords format.
* Restructured imports; all drivers are now imported directly from `qblox_instruments` as follows:
    * from qblox_instruments import Cluster, Pulsar, SpiRack
    * from qblox_instruments.qcodes_drivers.spi_rack_modules import D5aModule, S4gModule
* With the new Cluster firmware release, the user now interacts with the Cluster as a single instrument instead
  of a rack of instruments. The new Cluster driver reflects this. It detects where and which modules are in the rack
  and automatically makes them accessible as an InstrumentChannel submodule accessible as `Cluster.module<x>`, where
  `x` is the slot index of the rack.
* The Pulsar QCM and Pulsar QRM drivers have been combined into a single Pulsar driver that covers the functionality
  of both.
* The SPI Rack driver driver has been split into a native and QCoDeS layer to improve separation of functionality.
* Each sequencer's parameters are now accessible through it's own InstrumentChannel submodule. This means
  that parameters are now accessible as `module.sequencer<x>.parameter`, where `x` is the sequencer index.
* Renamed `get_system_status` to `get_system_state` to be inline with other state method names.
* The methods `get_system_state` and `get_sequencer_state` now return namedtuples of type `SystemState` and
  `SequencerState` respectively to ease handling of the returned statuses and accompanying flags.
* Renamed the sequencer's `waveform_and_programs` parameter to `sequence`.
* The way to configure the driver as a dummy has been changed to use enums for module type selection.
* Added keep alive pinging to the socket interface to keep the instrument connection from closing after
  a platform dependant idle period.
* Fixed general code duplication problem between instruments.
* Introduced `qblox-cfg` as the new configuration management tool with which to update the Cluster and Pulsar
  instruments. As of Pulsar firmware release v0.7.0 and Cluster firmware release v0.2.0, the configuration
  management tool is no longer shipped with the release, but instead `qblox-cfg` must be used. This new tool provides
  far more functionality and exposes the improved network configurability of the latest firmware releases.
* On top of the new configuration management tool, `qblox-pnp` is also instroduced as the new network debug tool.
  This tool, in combination with the latest firmware releases, allows to easily find instruments in the network and
  to potentially recover them in case of network/IP configuration problems.
* Improved unit test coverage.
* Updated the documentation on Read the Docs to reflect the changes.
* Added various improvements and fixes to the tutorials.
