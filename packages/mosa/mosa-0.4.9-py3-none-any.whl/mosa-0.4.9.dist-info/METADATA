# Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA)

Simulated Annealing (SA) has been initially proposed in [*Optimization by Simulated Annealing*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.220.4598.671) as an optimization heuristic. Multi-objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) extends the original, single-objective SA to approximate the Pareto front in multi-objective optimization problems. A thorough discussion about MOSA and its algorithm variants can be found in [*Multi-objective Simulated Annealing: Principles and Algorithm Variants*](https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/8134674).

Very basic documentation is hosted on the [project's Github website](https://github.com/rgaveiga/mosa). Jupyter notebooks in the *test* directory provide usage examples.
