## Introduction

### **CLIbrary**

**CLIbrary** is *a standardized collection of CLI utilities written in Python to handle commands, I/O and files*. This means it is a set of functions that simplifies writing programs based on it by providing a coherent environment.

**CLIbrary** provides functions to:
* Manage a CLI interface through command-and-options handling.
* Easily access to the program's *help*.
* Seamlessly load and dump informations to files.
* Handle various type of inputs without having to worry about consistency and errors.
* Output different type of informations such as errors and warnings.

**CLIbrary** is written in Python and developed by [Andrea Di Antonio](https://github.com/diantonioandrea).

### Handlers

Handlers play an important role inside **CLIbrary**.  
Every function accepts only a handler which is a dictionary structured as {"option": value}.

## Interface

[Go back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### CLI

	def cmdIn(commandHandler={}) -> dict

*cmdIn* stands for *Command Input* as this function allows the user to input command as in a CLI interface.

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* request, str: The prompt to the user.
* addedChars, str: A set of characters to be automatically added to the prompt. Default is ": ".
* style, str[^1]: A particular colour style to be applied to the prompt.
* verbose, bool.
* allowedCommands, list: A list of all the allowed commands for the CLI interface.
* helpPath, str: The path to the help JSON. This enables the *help* command.

This function returns a dictionary with the following keys:
* command, str: The command.
* sdOpts, dict: A dictionary containing single-dash options as {"opts1": "value1", "opts2": "value2", ...}[^2].
* ddOpts, list: A list containing double-dash options as [opts1, opts2, ...].

Commands are always structured as:

	command -sdOpt value --ddOpt

with no more than a single word for the command itself.

[^1]: Colorama styling works best for styling inside **CLIbrary**.

[^2]: The options get returned without the dash.

### Help

	def helpPrint(handler={}) -> None

*helpPrint* is a function that reads and print the help JSON whose path gets passed to *cmdIn*.

A help entry must be formatted this way:

	"command": {
			"description": "Command description.",
			"options": {"-sdOpt#": "VALUE", "-sdOpt": "VALUE", "--ddOpt": ""}
		}

where mandatory options get identified by a "#" and double-dash options don't require a value description.  
There is no need to call this function manually as its operation is embedded inside *cmdIn*.

## Files

[Go back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

**CLIbrary** provides two functions to handle files loading and dumping: *aLoad* and *aDump*. These functions make a great use of the Python module Pickle.

### Loading

	def aLoad(fileHandler: dict)

*aLoad* stands for *Automatic Loading* as this function loads informations from files without user confirmation.

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* path, str: The path to the file.
* ignoreMissing, bool: Whether to display an error on missing files.

### Dumping

	def aDump(fileHandler: dict) -> None

*aDump* stands for *Automatic Dumping* as this function dumps informations to files without user confirmation.

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* path, str: The path to the file.
* data: The data to be dumped.

## Inputs

[Go back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Strings

	def strIn(stringHandler={}) -> str

*strIn* stands for *String Input* as this function's purpose is receiving string inputs.

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* request, str: The prompt to the user.
* addedChars, str: A set of characters to be automatically added to the prompt.
* allowedChars, list: The set of allowed characters which aren't letters.
* allowedAnswers, list: The list of the only allowed answers, if not empty.
* allowedStyle, str: The style of the *allowedAnswers* hint.
* blockedAnswers, list: The list of the blocked answers.
* noSpace, bool: Whether to allow or not the use of spaces.
* fixedLength, int: The length of the accepted answer, if different from zero.
* verification, bool: Whether to ask for an answer verification. Useful for passwords.
* verbose, bool.

The returned value isn't case sensitive.

### Numbers

	def numIn(numberHandler={})

*numIn* stands for *Number Input* as this function's purpose is receiving numeric inputs.

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* request, str: The prompt to the user.
* addedChars, str: A set of characters to be automatically added to the prompt.
* allowedRange, list: The range in which the function accepts an answer, if not empty.
* allowedTypes, list: Whether to accept just integer or integer and floats.
* round, int: The number of decimal to round to, if different from -1.
* noSpace, bool: Whether to allow or not the use of spaces.
* verbose, bool.

### Booleans

	def boolIn(boolHandler={}) -> bool

*boolIn* stands for *Boolean Input* as this function's purpose is receiving boolean inputs.

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* request, str: The prompt to the user.
* addedChars, str: A set of characters to be automatically added to the prompt.
* verbose, bool.

### Dates

	def dateIn(dateHandler={}) -> str

*dateIn* stands for *Date Input* as this function's purpose is receiving date inputs.

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* request, str: The prompt to the user.
* addedChars, str: A set of characters to be automatically added to the prompt.
* verbose, bool.

### List handling

	def listCh(listHandler={})

*listCh* stands for *List Choice* as this function returns the choosen element from a list.

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* list, list: The list from which the element gets choosen.
* request, str: The prompt to the user.

## Outputs

[Go back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Erros, warning and verbose

	def output(outputHandler: dict)

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* string, str: The output string.
* error, bool.
* warning, bool.
* verbose, bool.
* errorStyle, str.
* warningStyle, str.
* verboseStyle, str.
* before, str: A string that gets printed before the output and is unaffected by the output styling.
* after, str: A string that gets printed after the output and is unaffected by the output styling.
