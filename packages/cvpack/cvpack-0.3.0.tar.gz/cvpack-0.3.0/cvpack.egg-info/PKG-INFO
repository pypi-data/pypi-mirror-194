### Overview

Collective variables (CVs) are functions of the coordinates of a molecular system and provide a
means to project its conformational state onto a lower-dimensional space. By stimulating the
dynamics of a judiciously chosen set of CVs, one can obtain an enhanced sampling of the
configurational space, including regions that are otherwise difficult to access. CVPack is a Python
package that provides pre-defined CVs for the powerful molecular dynamics engine
[OpenMM](https://openmm.org). All these CVs are subclasses of OpenMM's [Force] class. As such, they
can be directly added to a [CustomCVForce] object or used to define a [BiasVariable] object for
[Metadynamics], for example.

The CVs currently implemented in CVPack are:

* [Angle](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/Angle.html):
    The angle formed by three atoms.
* [Atomic Function](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/AtomicFunction.html):
    A user-defined function of the coordinates of a group of atoms.
* [Centroid Function](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/CentroidFunction.html)
    A user-defined function of the centroids of groups of atoms.
* [Distance](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/Distance.html):
    The distance between two atoms.
* [Helix angle content](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/HelixAngleContent.html):
    The alpha-helix angle content of a sequence of residues.
* [Helix H-bond content](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/HelixHBondContent.html):
    The alpha-helix hydrogen-bond content of a sequence of residues.
* [Helix RMSD content](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/HelixRMSDContent.html):
    The alpha-helix RMSD content of a sequence of residues
* [Helix torsion content](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/HelixTorsionContent.html):
    The alpha-helix Ramachandran content of a sequence of residues.
* [Number of contacts](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/NumberOfContacts.html):
    The number of contacts between two groups of atoms.
* [Radius of gyration](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/RadiusOfGyration.html):
    The radius of gyration of a group of atoms.
* [RMSD](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/RMSD.html):
    The RMSD of a group of atoms with respect to a reference structure.
* [Torsion](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/Torsion.html):
    The torsion angle formed by four atoms.
* [Torsion similarity](https://cvpack-for-openmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/TorsionSimilarity.html):
    The degree of similarity between pairs of torsion angles.
