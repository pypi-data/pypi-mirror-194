Description: # i3a
        
        i3a is a set of scripts used for automation of i3 and sway window manager
        layouts.
        
        ## Automation list
        
        ### i3a-master-stack
        
        Provides automatic master-stack layout, which is known from e.g. DWM. The
        following kinds of the layout are possible:
        
        - master-stack area with DWM-like stack (stack windows are split)
        - master-stack area with i3-like stack (stack windows are actual stack)
        
        ### i3a-swap
        
        Swap master and stack areas from i3a-master-stack (technically it doesn't
        require running i3-master-stack).
        
        ### i3-swallow
        
        Provides automatic "swallowing": when a program runs a child process, the
        parent is automatically hidden (moved to the scratchpad), which looks like if
        it was replaced, or "swallowed" by the child window. It is especially useful
        for graphical programs (video player, document viewer etc.) run from the
        terminal.
        
        Provides a means of filtering both parent programs which can be swallowed and
        child programs which can trigger swallowing.
        
        ### i3a-move-to-empty
        
        Moves currently focused container to the first empty workspace. Keep in mind
        that this script relies on numbering of the workspaces.
