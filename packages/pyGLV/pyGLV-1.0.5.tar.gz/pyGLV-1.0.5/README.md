# The pyGLV package

## pyGLV (computer **G**raphics for deep **L**earning and scientific **V**isualization)

A python, pure software design pattern based package that used plain and simple **E**ntities, **C**omponents and **S**ystems in a **S**cenegraph architecture from thge `pyECSS` package, in order to showcase basic, cross-platform OpenGL-based real-time computer graphics with applications to scientific visualization and deep learning.

- Decorator Pattern: *RenderDecorator, ComponentDecorator, SystemDecorator*
- game-loop pattern (GPP non GoF): *Scene*
