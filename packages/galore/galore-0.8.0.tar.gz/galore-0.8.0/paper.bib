abstract = {The study of molecules in the gas phase by ESCA offers several advantages. Particularly{\{},{\}} the opportunity to make direct comparisons between theoretical and experimental results is of importance. From such comparisons a more complete understanding of several fundamental phenomena in ESCA has been gained. The present paper reviews some recent work in Uppsala along this line. The effect of electron reorganization on core binding energies in atoms and molecules is analyzed. Chemical shifts in ESCA and n.m.r. are discussed. The existence of a general relation involving these chemical shifts and nuclear spin-rotation constants is pointed out. A model for analyzing ESCA intensities of the valence electrons in molecules is presented. It is shown that the analysis may be useful in identifying the molecular orbitals.For most applications of ESCA it is highly desirable to improve the resolution and the intensity. An instrument{\{},{\}} particularly designed to achieve this for gases{\{},{\}} is discussed. It can also handle solid samples. It makes use of a high-emission{\{},{\}} fine-focus electron gun{\{},{\}} a rotating anode and a double focusing quartz crystal. The first electron spectrum recorded with this new instrument is presented.},

@article{Glans2005,
abstract = {The electronic structures of HgO and Tl2O3 have been investigated by valence and core-level x-ray photoemission, x-ray absorption, and x-ray emission spectroscopies. Valence-band photoemission under Al K$\alpha$ excitation is dominated by the metal 5d partial density of states and thus provides a sensitive probe of shallow core mixing into the O 2p valence-band states. Conversely O K shell emission is determined by the O 2p partial density of states and therefore allows the extent of corresponding mixing of O 2p character into the shallow core states to be measured. The experimental work is supported by band-structure calculations carried out within the framework of density-functional theory. It is shown that the bonding in HgO involves significant mixing between O 2p states and both Hg 6s and shallow core 5d states: the calculated O 2p partial density of states mirrors the O K shell emission spectrum and reveals significant O 2p character within the shallow core Hg 5d states. There is, however, little direct on-site mixing between the Hg 6s and 5d states. In Tl2O3, the hybridization of the deeper metal 5d states with O 2p states is much less pronounced than in HgO. Moreover, the states at the bottom of what is conventionally regarded as the O 2p valence band are found in fact to have very strong Tl 6s atomic character. The photoemission spectrum of Tl2O3 shows a well-defined metallic Fermi edge: the shape of the structure around the photoemission onset suggests that the metallic nature of Tl2O3 arises from an occupation of states above the main valence-band edge, probably arising from oxygen vacancy defects. The conduction electrons of Tl2O3 are strongly perturbed by ionization of Tl core levels, giving rise to distinctive plasmon satellites in core x-ray photoemission spectroscopy.},

abstract = {High-resolution core- and valence-level photoemission spectra of Nb-doped TiO2 ceramics (Ti1-xNbxO2 with 0.01{\textless}x{\textless}0.8) have been measured using monochromatic x-ray excitation. Nb doping produces a welldefined photoemission peak in the bulk band gap of rutile, whose intensity increases with increasing doping level. Core-level spectroscopy shows that the Nb is incorporated within the rutile lattice at low doping levels mainly as Nb{\~{}}V! and that the gap state is associated with Ti(III) ions. This conclusion is reinforced by variable energy photoemission measurements on Ti0.9Nb0.1O2 in the vicinity of the Ti 3p and Nb 4p core thresholds. The photoemission resonance profile for the gap states reaches half maximum intensity at the same energy as found for oxygen-deficient TiO2-x but is shifted from the resonance profile for the Nb 4d states of NbO2. STM images on Nb-doped TiO2(110) are considered in relation to the spectroscopic measurements. Nb dopant atoms are imaged as "bright spot" clusters, implying delocalization of charge from Nb onto neighboring Ti ions. The experimental x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data are compared with density-of-states profiles derived from local-density approximation calculations on pure and Nb-doped TiO2 clusters. These calculations show that Nb doping of TiO2 introduces new states of mixed Nb 4d-Ti 3d character above the O 2p valence band of the host material. In addition, there is increased x-ray photoemission intensity across the O 2p valence band owing to strong Nb 4d/O 2p hybridization and a cross section for ionization of Nb 4d states that is an order of magnitude larger than that for O 2p or Ti 3d states.},

@article{Mudd2014,
abstract = {N-type CdO is a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) which has promise in a number of areas including solar cell applications. In order to realize this potential a detailed knowledge of the electronic structure of the material is essential. In particular, standard density functional theory (DFT) methods struggle to accurately predict fundamental material properties such as the band gap. This is largely due to the underestimation of the Cd 4d binding energy, which results in a strong hybridization with the valence-band (VB) states. In order to test theoretical approaches, comparisons to experiment need to be made. Here, synchrotron-radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SR-PES) measurements are presented, and comparison with three theoretical approaches are made. In particular the position of the Cd 4d state is measured with hard x-ray PES, and the orbital character of the VB is probed by photon energy dependent measurements. It is found that LDA + U using a theoretical U value of 2.34 eV is very successful in predicting the position of the Cd 4d state. The VB photon energy dependence reveals the O 2p photoionization cross section is underestimated at higher photon energies, and that an orbital contribution from Cd 5p is underestimated by all the DFT approaches.},

@article{Togo2015a,
abstract = {We explore the role of entanglement in adiabatic quantum optimization by performing approximate simulations of the real-time evolution of a quantum system while limiting the amount of entanglement. To classically simulate the time evolution of the system with a limited amount of entanglement, we represent the quantum state using matrix-product states and projected entangled-pair states. We show that the probability of finding the ground state of an Ising spin glass on either a planar or non-planar two-dimensional graph increases rapidly as the amount of entanglement in the state is increased. Furthermore, we propose evolution in complex time as a way to improve simulated adiabatic evolution and mimic the effects of thermal cooling of the quantum annealer.},
