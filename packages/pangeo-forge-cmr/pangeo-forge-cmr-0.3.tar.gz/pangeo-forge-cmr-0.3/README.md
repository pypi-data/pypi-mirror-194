# pangeo-forge-cmr

Small library that integrates NASA's [Common Metadata Repository](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/cmr)
(CMR) with [pangeo-forge-recipes](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-recipes).
The goal is to help make pangeo-forge recipes that use CMR for getting raw data.

## Installation

You can install this from PyPI with `pip install pangeo-forge-cmr`.

## Example

```python
from pangeo_forge_recipes.recipes import XarrayZarrRecipe
from pangeo_forge_cmr import files_from_cmr

# Get the GPM IMERG Late Precipitation Daily data
shortname = 'GPM_3IMERGDL'

recipe = XarrayZarrRecipe( # We are making Zarr, could be something else too
    files_from_cmr( # Provide a list of files by querying CMR
        shortname,
        nitems_per_file=1,
        concat_dim='time',  # Describe how the dataset is chunked
    ),
    inputs_per_chunk=12,
)
```
