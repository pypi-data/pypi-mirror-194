    """
Special military operations, also known as special operations, refer to military activities that are conducted by specially trained personnel using unconventional tactics and techniques. Some common features of special military operations include:

Highly trained personnel: Special military operations are carried out by highly trained and skilled personnel who are often drawn from elite units.
Unconventional tactics and techniques: Special military operations involve the use of unconventional tactics and techniques that are not typically employed in conventional military operations.
Secrecy and discretion: Special military operations are often carried out in secret and with a high degree of discretion, to avoid detection and minimize the risk of retaliation.
High risk and high reward: Special military operations are often high risk, but also offer the potential for high rewards in terms of achieving strategic objectives.
Rapid deployment: Special military operations often require rapid deployment, with personnel and equipment capable of being rapidly deployed to the target location.
