### A script to automate daily Bing rewards points
Please submit an issue or pull-request if you have an idea for a feature

#### :exclamation: NOTE: Compatibilty with browsers seems hit and miss. I have confirmed intended behavoir using Brave 1.48.158 (Chromium 110.0.5481.77) on Windows 10 Pro. It's worth trying out several Chromium based browsers to see what works best for you (see `--exe` flag or config file)

## **Features:**

* Spoofs user agent to appear as Mobile or Desktop Edge Browser using Chrome/Brave!
* Script auto-types searches, so must be run in a GUI environment. Great for AFK grinding once a day for those points
* Use a mobile user agent to get mobile points (`--mobile`)
* Configurable number of searches with `--count=`
* All files are local, makes no http(s) requests
* Only one external dependance (PyAutoGUI)
* Fine tune delay and set browser executable with config at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or %APPDATA% on Windows
* Best Value: gift cards: **1,050 points / $1** (current rate)
***

## **Install from PyPI!**

```bash
pip install bing-rewards
```
Will make the executable `bing-rewards` available on your PATH.
Look below or try the `--help` flag to see detailed usage.

**Recommended**: Use a virtual environment or [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to avoid poluting your global package path with executable apps. See: [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)
```bash 
pipx install bing-rewards
```

## **Requirements:**

- At least Python 3.6.

- [PyAutoGUI](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui) package is used to control keypresses and type Bing search URLS.
WARNING: This script *will* take control away from the keyboard while running. PyAutoGUI performs key presses. i.e., it does not operate headless or in the background.

- `chrome` must be discoverable on the system PATH. [Download Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/).
If you use a different chromium based browser that supports setting user agents via the `--user-agent` option (tested with Brave), you can use the `--exe` flag with an absolute path to the browser executable to use. Also see the `"browser-path"` key in the config file.

- To earn points from searching, you must also have logged into [bing.com](https://www.bing.com) with your Microsoft account at least once, to save cookies.

## **Usage:**

#### `bing-rewards [-h] [--no-window] [-n] [--exe EXE] [-c COUNT] [-d | -m]`

Ex:
Complete mobile and desktop daily points

`$ bing-rewards`

Run 10 searches with mobile user-agent in a new window

`$ bing-rewards -m -c10`

`$ bing-rewards --mobile --count=10`

Launches Chrome as a subprocess with special flags. Only tested on Windows 10, however it should work on other platforms

⚠️Known Issue: No other instance of chrome.exe can be open when the script runs. Chrome prevents different user agents in each window. The script will run, but Chrome will not appear as Edge


## **All options:**

Running with no options will complete mobile and desktop daily search quota. The following options are available to change the default behavior.
| Flag              | Option                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-h`, `--help`    | Display help and exit                                                               |
| `-c`, `--count=N` | Override the number of searches to complete                                         |
| `-d`, `--desktop` | Only use desktop user agent                                                         |
| `-m`, `--mobile`  | Only use a mobile user agent                                                        |
| `-n`, `--dryrun`  | Do everything but type the search query                                             |
| `-X`, `--no-exit` | Do not close the browser after completing a search                                  |
| `--exe EXE`       | The full path of the Chrome compatible browser executable (Brave and Chrome tested) |
| `--nowindow`      | Don't open a new Chrome window, just type the keys                                  |


## User agents:

If interested, the following user agents are passed to Chrome using the `--user-agent` argument. These are clearly defined at the top of `bing-rewards.py`.

Edge Browser on Windows 10 desktop:
> Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.61 Safari/537.36 Edg/83.0.478.37

Mobile Edge Browser on Windows 10 phone:
> Mozilla/5.0 (Windows Phone 10.0; Android 6.0.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.102 Mobile Safari/537.36 Edge/18.19041
