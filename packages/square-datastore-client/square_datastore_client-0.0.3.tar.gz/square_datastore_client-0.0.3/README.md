# SQuARE Datastore Client
This package facilites the interaction with datastores hosted in [UKP-SQuARE](https://square.ukp-lab.de/).

## Installation
```bash
pip install square-datastore-client
```

## Usage
After installing, Datastores in SQuARE can be called easily. Before running the code, the follinwg environment variables need to be set.
```bash
export SQUARE_API_URL=https://square.ukp-lab.de/api
export KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL=https://square.ukp-lab.de
export REALM=square
export CLIENT_ID=<INSERT>
export CLIENT_SECRET=<INSERT>
```
- `SQUARE_API_URL`: The address where the SQuARE API's are hosted. For UKP-SQuARE set this to `https://square.ukp-lab.de/api`. If you run SQuARE locally, set this to your address.
- `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL`: The address where tokens can be obtained from. For UKP-SQuARE set this to `https://square.ukp-lab.de`
- `REALM`: The realm in which your Keycloak client resides. For UKP-SQuARE this is `square`.
- `CLIENT_ID`: The ID of your client. For UKP-SQuARE, you will receive this from the UI when creating a new skill.*
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: The secret of your client/skill. For UKP-SQuARE, you will receive this from the UI when creating a new skill.*

*) This is currently not supported in the UI. However, when you open the developer tab in your browser, you will see the response from the API containing the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
