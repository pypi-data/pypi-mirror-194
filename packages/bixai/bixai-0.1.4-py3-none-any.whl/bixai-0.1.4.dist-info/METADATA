# `bixai`

The `bixai` is a package made for NLO to make an attempt at understanding drivers behind models

It contains multiple modules to analyse different problems:
1. Decomposition for logistic regressions over time
2. Multivariate logistic regression with impact of variables 
3. Visualize a decision tree
4. Time-series forecasting with regressions and random forest
