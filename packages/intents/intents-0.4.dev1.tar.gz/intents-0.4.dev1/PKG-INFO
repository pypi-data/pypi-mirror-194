**Intents** is a Python framework to define and operate
Conversational Agents with a simple, code-first approach. *Intents* comes with
built-in support for Dialogflow ES and experimental Alexa and Snips connectors. Its main benefits are:

* **Agents are Python projects**. You will develop with autocomplete, static type checking
  and everything you are already used to.
* **Versioning and CI**. Agents can be versioned on Git, and programmatically
  deployed just like software.
* **Human-friendly Connectors**. Intents are classes, predictions are their
  instances. Support can be extended beyond Dialogflow by implementing custom connectors.

A detailed view of the available features can be found in
[STATUS.md](STATUS.md). Also, check out the
[Projects](https://github.com/dariowho/intents/projects) page to keep track of
recent developments.

## Install

```sh
pip install intents
```

## Usage

Intents are defined like standard Python **dataclasses**:

```python
@dataclass
class HelloIntent(Intent):
    """A little docstring for my Intent class"""
    user_name: Sys.Person = "Guido"
MyAgent.register(HelloIntent)
```

Their **language** resources are stored in separate YAML files:

```yaml
utterances:
  - Hi! My name is $user_name{Guido}
  - Hello there, I'm $user_name{Mario}

responses:
  default:
    - text:
      - Hi $user_name
      - Hello $user_name, this is Bot!
```

Agents can be **uploaded** as Dialogflow ES projects directly from code:

```python
df = DialogflowEsConnector('/path/to/service-account.json', MyAgent)
df.upload()  # You will find it in your Dialogflow Console
```

*Intents* will act transparently as a **prediction** client:

```python
predicted = df.predict("Hi there, my name is Mario")
predicted.intent            # HelloIntent(user_name="Mario")
predicted.intent.user_name  # "Mario"
predicted.fulfillment_text  # "Hello Mario, this is Bot!"
```

For a complete working example, check out the included [Example Agent](example_agent/). Also, *Intents* **documentation** is published at https://intents.readthedocs.io/ ðŸ“š
