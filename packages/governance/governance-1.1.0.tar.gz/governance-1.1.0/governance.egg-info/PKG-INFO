Description: # Governance
        
        `governance` is a Python package for connecting a python notebook environment to the Mission Control MLOps platform. Mission Control enables teams to accelerate quality, velocity, and trust in their data science lifecycle by tightly embedding governance and compliance requirements directly into notebooks, and submitting testing and evaluation results to Mission Control for trust analysis.
        
        More information about Mission Control can be found at www.takecontrol.ai. Interested teams can request Sandbox access to the Enterprise Server Edition.

        You can install `governance` using pip:
        
        ```pip install governance```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Submitting testing and evaluation results to Mission Control
        
        ```python
        # test.py
        import governance
        
        governance.set_api_key("<YOUR MISSION CONTROL API KEY>")
