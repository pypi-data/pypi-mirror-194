# Virtual

Welcome to Virtual - the Python project that lets you run all sorts of 'operating systems' - inside a virtual environment!  
Virtual is designed to make programs built for the community, by the community, easier to build. We provide many libraries for independent developers to built cool apps upon our software. You can contribute to our mission on [GitHub](https://github.com/dylanopen/virtualpy).

## Why use Virtual?

Virtual has many security features in place to prevent any malicious activity an app is attempting, such as a sandboxed environment only allowing access to the virtual environment the app is running in.

For developers, Virtual makes it easier to create programs, thanks to an extensive Python library allowing this.
