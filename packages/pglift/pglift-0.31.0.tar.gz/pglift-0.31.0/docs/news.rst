.. towncrier release notes start

0.31.0 - 2023-02-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features
++++++++

- A new logrotate service has been added to generate logrotate configuration
  file for each instance.
- The ``passfile`` site setting, under ``postgresql.auth`` section now accepts a
  ``null`` value in order to completely disable support for the password file.
  When disabled, ``--pgpass`` option to ``role`` commands are no longer
  available.
- Validate existence of ``bindir`` fields set in ``postgresql.versions``
  setting.


Bug fixes
+++++++++

- Define the ``cluster_name`` in ``postgresql.conf`` template file, thus
  allowing to create instances without the value (which used to be hard-coded
  from instance name).


Removals
++++++++

- The ``pgpass`` field in ``roles`` items for an ``Instance`` is no longer
  supported (in Ansible or the declarative API). The field can still be
  specified on ``Role`` objects.
- To enable SSL in PostgreSQL configuration file, in addition to setting
  ``ssl`` to ``true``, providing ``ssl_cert_file`` and ``ssl_key_file`` is
  required. The previous self-signed certificate is no longer generated.
- No longer output the ``pgpass`` field when listing roles.


Documentation
+++++++++++++

- The commands for exporting the Ansible doc fragments have been simplified for
  the release workflow. Now it is only a copy of the data files already
  generated for the tests.
- Add a note about the ability for devs to run systemd jobs on sourcehut.
- Document sudo pre-requisites for systemd "system" mode with a sudoers entry example.


0.30.0 - 2023-02-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features
++++++++

- Make it possible to specify the schema in which a database extension would be installed.

  Until now, when an extension was added to a database, the extension's objects were
  installed by default on the current schema of the database (usually ``public``
  schema).

  Now, the name of the ``schema`` in which to install the extension's objects can be
  specified when adding or altering extensions, by specifying it in the manifest.
- Add a ``-f/--follow`` option to ``instance logs`` command to follow log output
  and log file change.
- Log create/alter/delete operations on database extensions.
- Add support for TLS encryption settings for patroni REST API.
- Log messages from pgBackRest commands: ``pgbackrest`` commands are now invoked
  with ``--log-level-stderr=info`` and respective messages are forwarded to
  pglift's logger at ``DEBUG`` level (as are all ``stderr`` messages from
  subprocesses).
- Configure pgBackRest on standby instances, even in ``repository.path``
  mode, removing a previous limitation from the implementation.

  In addition, when calling ``instance backup <instance>`` with ``<instance>``
  being a standby, ``pgbackrest`` is now invoked with ``--backup-standby``
  option.
- Setup pgbackrest on standby instances when using a remote repository.
- Add support for TLS for Etcd for HA with Patroni via site-settings.
- Make ``host_port`` and ``host_config`` item of pgbackrest's repo-host settings
  optional.
- Separate server from client pgbackrest configuration in remote repository
  mode.
- temboard-agent V8 is now needed for pglift, older versions are no longer supported.


Bug fixes
+++++++++

- Do not write the ``port`` value in ``postgresql.conf`` if it has the default
  value.
- If any change in the configuration files is detected for prometheus or temboard,
  we now perform a restart of the services for the changes to take effect.
- Fix possibly not working ``Exec`` command in postgresql systemd unit file.


Removals
++++++++

- If pgbackrest is enabled, the stanza name must now be provided upon instance
  creation.
- Temboard-agent SSL files are no longer auto-generated, their path must be provided
  in site-settings. The ``certificate`` field containing ``cert`` and ``key`` is
  required in temboard section.
- CLI option ``--extension`` of ``database alter`` command has been removed.
- CLI option ``--in-role`` of ``role alter`` command has been removed.
- Patroni etcd ``host`` setting has been replaced by ``hosts``.
- Configuration for etcd for HA with patroni is now managed in site settings.

  Etcd host can no longer be provided by user when creating an instance.


Documentation
+++++++++++++

- Update the Ansible tutorial to refer to the collection and simplify
  installation steps.
- Warn about the prerequisites for using ``systemctl --user``.
- Document patroni etcd ``hosts`` setting usage
- Document Patroni security (TLS support)
- Recommend to use systemd as a service manager when operating with pgBackRest
  in remote repository mode.


Misc.
+++++

- Add ``--pg1-path`` option to ``pgbackrest archive-push`` command set in
  PostgreSQL ``archive_command``.


0.29.0 - 2022-12-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features
++++++++

- Improve warning message when failing to connect to primary instance in
  ``instance get``.
- Make `replication` role a member of ``pg_read_all_stats``.
- Add WAL sender state (from `pg_stat_replication
  <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-REPLICATION-VIEW>`_
  view) to standby information (as available in ``instance get`` command).
- Export paths to PostgreSQL data and WAL directories when getting an Instance
  (e.g. through ``instance get -o json`` command).
- Introduce ``$PGLIFT_CONFIG_PATH`` environment variable.

  This new variable allows users to provide a path to site configuration files
  to be taken into account prior to ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pglift`` or
  ``/etc/pglift``.
- Preserve user edits of Patroni configuration file.
- Add support for pgbackrest remote host repository.


Bug fixes
+++++++++

- Catch JSON decode exception when parsing ``SETTINGS`` environment variable.

  This prevents showing a traceback when the json provided for ``SETTINGS``
  environment variable is invalid.
- Catch :class:`~pglift.exceptions.SettingsError` when loading site settings
  in CLI.

  Prevents displaying a traceback if there's an error when parsing the site
  settings YAML file.
- Fix path to pglift in systemd service when using pre-built binary

  `ExecPath` in ``pglift-postgresql@`` systemd service which was wrongly set
  to an inexistent path.


Removals
++++++++

- Require pgbackrest>=2.41

  ``pglift instance backups`` now runs ``pgbackrest info --set=<backup set>
  --output=json`` which only works since pgbackrest 2.41.
- Hide ``standby.status`` field from ``instance get`` output: this field is
  not very useful since it will only appear on standby instances, which are by
  definition in *demoted* state.
- Change priority order of site config files. Order is now xdg > etc > dist.
- Improve instance privileges command help message
- Drop `archive-push` section in global pgbackrest configuration.
- Replace ``pgbackrest.repopath`` setting by ``pgbackrest.repository``, now an
  object with keys ``path`` and ``retention`` (see ``pglift site-settings
  --schema`` for details). The ``path`` field is now required and has no default
  value, in contrast with ``repopath`` previously.
- The ``site-settings`` command output format is now YAML by default.


Documentation
+++++++++++++

- Add a section in docs for site configuration templates.
- Explain how base pgBackRest configuration is installed, and how to override
  it.
- Improve and clarify documentation about systemd in `system` mode.


Misc.
+++++

- Use pgbackrest's `recovery-option
  <https://pgbackrest.org/configuration.html#section-restore/option-recovery-option>`_
  when restoring a standby from a backup.
- Only restart PostgreSQL upon configuration changes, not all satellite
  services.


0.28.0 - 2022-12-02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features
++++++++

- If pgbackrest is enabled, log install and uninstall operations at
  ``site-configure``.
- Configure systemd timer for instance backup with a randomized delay.
- Add a ``--dry-run`` option to `apply` commands.
- Add support for "force" option for database drop.
- Improve logging when starting/stopping Prometheus `postgres_exporter` and
  `temboard-agent`.
- Allow to pass any command to ``instance exec`` (not just Postgres commands
  or absolute ones as previously).
- Make it possible to operate normal instances even when `patroni` is enabled
  in site settings.
- Add support for PostgreSQL 15.
- Make check for port availability more robust.
- Improve `systemd` unit template for PostgreSQL. It is now defined as a
  ``Type=notify`` service and does not use a ``PIDFile`` anymore, following
  more closely what's suggested in `PostgreSQL documentation
  <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-start.html>`_.


Bug fixes
+++++++++

- pglift 0.27.0 is now the minimum required version for the Ansible
  collection.
- Fixed error during enabling/disabling temboard service with systemd caused by a
  bad service name.
- Fix error in ``instance env`` command for a standby instance with pgbackrest
  enabled.
- Only start Patroni once at instance creation (avoid a stop and a start).
  This should make concurrent setups (e.g. from Ansible targeting different
  hosts in parallel) work without dead-locking Patroni.
- Avoid starting / stopping PostgreSQL many times at instance creation.


Removals
++++++++

- The Ansible collection got moved to its `own repository
  <https://gitlab.com/dalibo/pglift-ansible>`_.
- Avoid useless ``pgbackrest start`` invocation after stanza creation.
- Separate management of shared_preload_libraries and database extensions.

  The ``extensions`` key in instance's model has been dropped. To install
  extensions in an instance, you now need to provide the
  ``shared_preload_libraries`` in instance settings.
- No longer error out, but simply warn, upon invalid Patroni configuration as
  reported by ``patroni --validate-config``.
- Only validate generated Patroni configuration for Patroni version higher than
  2.1.5.



Documentation
+++++++++++++

- Extend how to about standby management with Ansible to illustrate promote
  operation.
- Add some details about `site configuration` in installation documentation.


Misc.
+++++

- Add a hidden ``--debug`` command-line flag to set log level to ``DEBUG`` and
  eventually get tracebacks displayed.
- Unconditionally call ``pgbackrest stanza-create`` upon instance.
  re-configuration whereas this was previously only done at instance creation.
  Conversely, the ``--no-online`` option is used to avoid superfluous instance
  startup. On the other hand the ``pgbackrest check`` command is still only
  emitted at instance creation.
- Add ``--output=json`` option to ``postgres_exporter apply`` command.
- Rework systemd installation through site-configure hook.
- Use pglift CLI in systemd unit for PostgreSQL.
- Use `towncrier <https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/>`_ to manage news
  fragments.

  API

Documentation
+++++++++++++
