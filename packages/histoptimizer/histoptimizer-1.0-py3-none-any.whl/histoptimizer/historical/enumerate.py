        Given a number of items `num_items` and a number of buckets
        `num_buckets`, enumerate lists of all the possible combinations of
        divider locations that partition `num_items` into `num_buckets`.

        The strategy is to start at the enumeration that has each divider in its
        left-most possible location, and then iterate all possible locations of
        the last (right-most) divider before incrementing the next-to-last and
        again iterating all possible locations of the last divider.

        When there are no more valid locations for the next-to-last divider,
        then the previous divider is incremented and the process repeated, and
        so on until the first divider and all subsequent dividers are in their
        largest (right-most) possible locations.
