1. Features
-----------

* Very fast writing by using linux system call ``sendfile()`` and large write buffers
* Writing an image to multiple USB sticks at once
* Optional validation after writing
* Adjustable write buffer between 4 KiB and 8 MiB
* Automatic device detection
* Detection and elimination of the following states of a device before writing:

  - Mounted

* Writing support for hybrid ISOs by checking the MBR signature
* Shows stats about writing time and overall speed

Planned:

* Deactivation of LVM2 volumes before writing
* Multilanguage support
* Redesign with own dark/light theme
* Distribution package support (DEB, RPM, Arch-Linux PKG)


2. Installation
---------------

* **Debian based linux:**

  You can download a `debian package`_ until ``USB-Imager`` is released in official debian repositories.

..

* **pip / pipenv:**

  If the distribution's own package manager is not supported yet, the ``USB-Imager`` can alternatively be installed via the Python package manager ``pip``.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install usb-imager
    $ pip uninstall usb-imager

  or `pipenv`_:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pipenv install usb-imager
    $ pipenv run usb-imager
    $ pipenv uninstall usb-imager


3. Usage
--------

Start USB-Imager via the desktop icon or just type ``usb-imager`` in your terminal window.


4. Troubleshooting:
-------------------

On some Linux distributions ``USB-Imager`` cannot be started from the command line or from a desktop icon after installation via ``pip``.

* Suggested solution for command line:

  ~/.local/bin may not be included in the executable search path due to a `bug`_, you have to manually add the directory to the PATH environment variable by adding it to ~/.profile in this case.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
