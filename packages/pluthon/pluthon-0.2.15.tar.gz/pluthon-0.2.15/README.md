Pluto-like programming language for Cardano Smart Contracts in Python

## What is this?

This is an programming language that compiles down to Untyped Plutus Language Core, inspired by MLabs [pluto](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/pluto)
programming language.
It is used as an intermediate step when compiling a pythonic smart contract language down to UPLC.

Contributions are very welcome.
