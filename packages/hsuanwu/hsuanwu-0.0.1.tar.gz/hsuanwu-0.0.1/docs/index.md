**Hsuanwu: Long-Term Evolution Project of Reinforcement Learning** is inspired by the long-term evolution (LTE) standard project in telecommunications, which aims to track the latest research progress in reinforcement learning (RL) and provide stable baselines.
The highlight features of Hsuanwu:

- 🧱 Complete decoupling of RL algorithms, and each method can be invoked separately;
- 📚 Large number of reusable bechmarking implementations;
- 🛠️ Support for RL model engineering deployment (C++ API);
