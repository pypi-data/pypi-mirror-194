It's syntax is roughly based on the basic syntax of the `apt` package manager, because Zeal CLI is basically a package manager for docsets.\n\n## Features\n- Simple, familiar command-line interface\n- Gets docsets from the same source as Zeal\n- Easy to install and use - no additional dependencies required.\n- Docsets can still be managed within the Zeal GUI\n- Free and Open-Source\n\n## Technologies\n- Python 3\n- PyInstaller\n\n## Usage\nView the [usage documentation](usage.md) for using instructions.\n\n## Contact\nTo submit a Bug Report or Feature Request, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Morpheus636/zeal-cli/issues/new).\n\nTo ask a question or get support, you can join my [Discord Server](https://discord.morpheus636.com) or create a Discussions thread within this repository.\n\n## Contributing\nThis project is maintained my Morpheus636. Contribution guidelines for all of my projects can be found at https://docs.morpheus636.com/contributing\n\n## Credits\n- Zeal_CLI sources docsets from [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash), just like Zeal. Special thanks to Dash's developer, [Kapeli](https://github.com/Kapeli) for granting me permission to use their docsets.\n\n# Copyright Notice\nÂ© Copyright 2021-2022 Josh Levin ([Morpheus636](https://github.com/morpheus636))\n\nThis repository (and everything in it) is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis repository is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
