# Zeal CLI
Zeal CLI is a command-line-interface for managing [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) docsets on Linux. It's syntax is roughly based on the basic syntax of the `apt` package manager, because Zeal CLI is basically a package manager for docsets.

## Features
- Simple, familiar command-line interface
- Gets docsets from the same source as Zeal
- Easy to install and use - no additional dependencies required.
- Docsets can still be managed within the Zeal GUI
- Free and Open-Source

## Technologies
- Python 3
- PyInstaller

## Usage
View the [usage documentation](usage.md) for using instructions.
