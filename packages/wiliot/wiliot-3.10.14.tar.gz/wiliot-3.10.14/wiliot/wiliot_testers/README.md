## Overview

* QR Scanner

        * Initialization
        * Check printer status

    * Main GUI support 3 QR values
        * QR enabling - if we want it to be functional during run - Enable only when printing SGTIN (Production)
        * QR comport - For this stage, since attenuator has the same comport name, we will have to config the comport
          for QR scanner once - until we will make it automatic
        * QR offset - every setup has different length from GW to QR scanner, the offset refers to the tags between,
          tags under QR scanner and GW are not included.

* Calibration

    * New Calibration process and GUI was created
    * Will be integrated to all testers
    * Calibration was integrated into offline tester
    * Before calibrating need to place golden tag under GW

* Test Suite:

    * New test methodology for tags - performance test
    * Support for Single & Dual band tags, Extended Single Band and Battery tags
    * Tests comes from JSON file located at local configs path

    * Tests available:
        * Single Band
        * High power
        * 5 sec test

    * Dual Band
        * Patterns 18/52 - 2 tests
        * Each test 5 sec
        * High power

    * Serialization failed warning message were added

* SampleTest:
    * new GUI entries: test name, operator, antenna version, surface.
    * Option to edit the tags in the test before ending the test (and re-run the test for specific tags).
    * Cloud communication: keep run the test when there is no connection (until the end of the test), warn the user on
      bad connection.
    * New batch scripts to run from pip/git (under SampleTest dir).
    * COM ports: option to reconnect between test iterations.
    * Save all files (logs, configs) under wiliot/common/SampleTest. (edited)
