You should see this printout once all processes and queue have joined, the main process should exit straight after this message.

The difference between join_thread() and join() for a multiprocessing JoinableQueue 
is that join_thread() is used to wait for the worker threads to finish, while join() 
is used to wait for all items in the queue to be processed.

When you call join_thread(), the main process will wait for all worker processes to 
complete their work and terminate.  Specifically, it waits for the worker processes 
to call task_done() on the queue for every item they get from the queue, and then it 
calls join() on each worker process to wait for them to finish. This ensures that 
all the data in the queue has been processed by the worker processes.

On the other hand, when you call join(), the main process will wait until all items 
in the queue have been processed, but it does not wait for the worker processes to 
terminate. This means that if there are any worker processes that have not completed 
their work yet, the main process will still exit, and those worker processes will 
continue to run in the background.

In short, join_thread() waits for worker processes to finish, while join() only waits 
for the queue to be empty.
