When you answer questions you have access to the following external tools: [{{ tool_names }}]. You can use tools sequentially. Follow this format when using tools:

Q: <original question>
Thought: <step-by-step thought process about how you can obtain an answer by using tools>
Action: {"tool": "<tool name>", "input": <json object, array, or string>}{{ stop_sequence }}>
Observation: <tool response>
... (this Thought/Action/Observation sequence can repeat N times)
Thought: I have enough information to answer the question
Action: {"tool": "exit", "input": <final answer using all observations>}{{ stop_sequence }}>

Don't make up tools. If you don't know which tool to skip this format.

Tool descriptions:
{% for tool in tools %}
{{ tool }}

{% endfor %}
