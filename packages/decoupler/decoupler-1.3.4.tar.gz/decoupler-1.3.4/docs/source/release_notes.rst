1.3.2
-----

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Added ``read_gmt`` function to read GMT files containing gene sets.

1.3.1
-----

~~~~~~~
- Omnipath wrappers (``get_resource``, ``get_dorothea`` and ``get_progeny``) now accept any organism name.

1.3.0
-----

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed change in api from ``sklearn.tree``.
- Forced gene names in ``extract`` to be in ``unicode`` format.
- Changed integer format from ``int32`` to ``int64`` to accommodate larger datasets across methods.

Additions
~~~~~~~~~
- Added conversion utility function ``translate_net`` to translate nets across organisms.

1.2.0
-----

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Removed ``python <3.10`` limitation.
- Forced ``np.float32`` type to output of ``get_contrast``.
- Made ``summarize_acts`` compatible with older versions of numpy.
- ``extract_psbulk_inputs`` now checks if mat and obs have matching indexes.
- ``plot_volcano`` now correctly can plot networks with different source names.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- ``extract`` now removes empty samples and features.
- ``run_consensus`` now follows the same format as other methods, old function is now called ``cons``.
- ``get_pseudobulk`` now checks if input are raw integer counts.
- ``plot_volcano`` now can plot without subsetting features by a network and can save plots to disk.
- ``plot_volcano`` now uses ``adjustText`` to better plot text labels.
- ``plot_volcano`` now can set logFCs and p-value limits for outliers.
- ``get_top_targets`` now can also work without subsetting features by a network and returns significant adjusted p-values.
- ``get_contrast`` now can also work without needing to group.
- ``udt`` and ``mdt`` now check if ``skranger`` and ``sklearn`` are installed, respectively.
- ``get_toy_data`` now contains more example TFs.
- ``get_top_targets`` now returns ``logFCs`` and ``pvals`` as column names instead of ``logFC`` and ``pval``.
- ``format_contrast_results`` now returns also the adjusted p-value.

Additions
~~~~~~~~~
- Added ``dense_run`` util function which runs methods ignoring zeros in the data.
- Added ``plot_violins`` and ``plot_barplot`` functions.
- Added ``p_adjust_fdr`` util function to correct p-values for FDR.
- Added ``get_ora_df`` function to infer ora from lists of genes instead of an input mat.
- Added ``shuffle_net`` function to randomize networks.
- Added benchmarking metrics ``metric_auroc``, ``metric_auprc``, ``metric_mcauroc`` and ``metric_mcauprc``.
- Added ``get_toy_benchmark_data`` function to generate a toy example for benchmarking.
- Added ``show_metrics`` function to show available metrics.
- Added  ``benchmark``, ``format_benchmark_inputs`` and ``get_performances`` functions to benchmark methods and nets.
- Added ``plot_metrics_scatter`` function to plot the results of running the benchmarking pipeline.
- Added ``plot_metrics_scatter_cols`` function to plot the results of running the benchmarking pipeline grouped by two levels.
- Added ``plot_metrics_scatter`` function to plot the results of running the benchmarking pipeline.
- Added ``plot_metrics_boxplot`` function to plot the distributions of Monte-Carlo benchmarking metrics.

1.1.0
-----
Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed ``get_pseudobulk`` errors.
- Fixed ``get_progeny`` to correctly return non duplicate entries.
- Fixed ``run_viper`` parallelization error.
- Fixed ``run_ora`` to correctly deal with random ties.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- ``get_dorothea`` now returns an ordered dataframe.
- ``get_contrast`` now prints warnings instead of returning an empty dataframe.

Additions
~~~~~~~~~
- Added ``get_top_targets`` util function.
- Added ``format_contrast_results`` util function.
