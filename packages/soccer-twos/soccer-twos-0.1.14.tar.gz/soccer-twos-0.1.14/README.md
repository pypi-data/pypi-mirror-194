## Usage

### For training

Import this package and instantiate the environment:

```python
import soccer_twos

env = soccer_twos.make()
```

The `make` method accepts several options:

The created `env` exposes a basic [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) interface.
Namely, the methods `reset()`, `step(action: Dict[int, np.ndarray])` and `close()` are available.
The `render()` method has currently no effect and `soccer_twos.make(render=True)` should be used instead.
The `step()` method returns extra information about the player and the ball in the last tuple element. This extra information includes position (x, y) and velocity (x, y) for the ball and players and y rotation (in degrees) of the players.

We expose an RLLib-compatible multiagent interface.
This means, for example, that `action` should be a `dict` where keys are integers in `{0, 1, 2, 3}` corresponding to each agent.
Additionally, values should be single actions shaped like `env.action_space.shape`.
Observations and rewards follow the same structure. Dones are only set for the key `__all__`, which means "all agents".
Agents 0 and 1 correspond to the blue team and agents 2 and 3 correspond to the orange team.

Here's a full example:

```python
import soccer_twos

env = soccer_twos.make(render=True)
print("Observation Space: ", env.observation_space.shape)
print("Action Space: ", env.action_space.shape)

team0_reward = 0
team1_reward = 0
while True:
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(
        {
            0: env.action_space.sample(),
            1: env.action_space.sample(),
            2: env.action_space.sample(),
            3: env.action_space.sample(),
        }
    )

    team0_reward += reward[0] + reward[1]
    team1_reward += reward[2] + reward[3]
    if done["__all__"]:
        print("Total Reward: ", team0_reward, " x ", team1_reward)
        team0_reward = 0
        team1_reward = 0
        env.reset()
```

#### Environment State Configuration

The `env_channel` parameter allows for state configuration inside the simulation. To use it, you must first instantiate a `soccer_twos.side_channels.EnvConfigurationChannel` and pass it in the `soccer_twos.make` call. Here's a full example:

```python
import soccer_twos
from soccer_twos.side_channels import EnvConfigurationChannel
env_channel = EnvConfigurationChannel()
env = soccer_twos.make(env_channel=env_channel)
env.reset()
env_channel.set_parameters(
    ball_state={
        "position": [1, -1],
        "velocity": [-1.2, 3],
    },
    players_states={
        3: {
            "position": [-5, 10],
            "rotation_y": 45,
            "velocity": [5, 0],
        }
    }
)
# env.step()
```

All the `env_channel.set_parameters` method parameters and dict keys are optional. You can set a single parameter at a time or the full game state if you need so.

### Evaluating

To quickly evaluate one agent against another and generate comprehensive statistics, you may use the `evaluate` script:

`python -m soccer_twos.evaluate -m1 agent_module -m2 opponent_module`

You can also provide the `--episodes` option to specify the number of episodes to evaluate on (defaults to 100).

### Watching

To rollout via CLI, you must create an implementation (subclass) of `soccer_twos.AgentInterface` and run:

`python -m soccer_twos.watch -m agent_module`

This will run a human-friendly version of the environment, where your agent will play against itself.
You may instead use the options `-m1 agent_module -m2 opponent_module` to play against a different opponent.
You may also implement your own rollout script using `soccer_twos.make(watch=True)`.

## Environment Specs

This environment is based on Unity ML Agents' [Soccer Twos](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/92ff2c26fef7174b443115454fa1c6045d622bc2/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#soccer-twos), so most of the specs are the same. Here, four agents compete in a 2 vs 2 toy soccer game, aiming to get the ball into the opponent's goal while preventing the ball from entering own goal.

- Observation space: a 336-dimensional vector corresponding to 11 ray-casts forward distributed over 120 degrees and 3 ray-casts backward distributed over 90 degrees, each detecting 6 possible object types, along with the object's distance. The forward ray-casts contribute 264 state dimensions and backward 72 state dimensions over three observation stacks.
- Action space: 3 discrete branched actions (MultiDiscrete) corresponding to forward, backward, sideways movement, as well as rotation (27 discrete actions).
- Agent Reward Function:
  - `1 - accumulated time penalty`: when ball enters opponent's goal. Accumulated time penalty is incremented by `(1 / MaxSteps)` every fixed update and is reset to 0 at the beginning of an episode. In this build, `MaxSteps = 5000`.
  - `-1`: when ball enters team's goal.

Note that while this is true when `variation == EnvType.multiagent_player`, observation and action spaces may vary for other variations.
