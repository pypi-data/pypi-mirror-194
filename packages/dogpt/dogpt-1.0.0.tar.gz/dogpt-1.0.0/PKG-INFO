        Advanced AI, but for dogs. 
        
        ## Animal welfare statement
        
        No animals were harmed during the development of this advanced AI.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Ensure you have Python installed, then:
        
        ```
        $ pip install dogpt
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Simply call the `dogpt` command from the terminal with some prompt text:
        
        ```
        $ dogpt in your considered opinion, what is the meaning of life?
        ```
        
        The output will display, with pauses (this is advanced AI that requires
        significant computational resources), to the terminal:
        
        ```
        woof play woof arf woof tummy rub sniff grrr
        ```
        
        ## API usage
        
        From within your code:
        
        ```python
        from dogpt import text
        
        prompt = input("What do you want to say to the dog? ")
        text(prompt)
        ```
        
        This fragment will pipe out the response to `STDOUT`.
