## Installation

### Virtual environment

It is generally advisable to install Python packages in [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
This is not necessary, but it will allow you to isolate the package and its dependencies from the rest of your computer.

### PyPi

Stemplate is available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/stemplate).
The easiest way to install it is to run the following command:

```bash
pip install stemplate
```

### Development mode

If you want to work on the package source files, you can install the package in [development mode](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#working-in-development-mode).
To do this on a POSIX system, clone, or download the project from its [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/stemplate/pypack) and execute the following command in it:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

This will automatically install a virtual environment containing all the necessary dependencies for the development and operation of the package.
For more information, see the shell script [`setup.sh`](/setup.sh).
