    A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by
    cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit
    or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks
    based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by
    a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies
    is that they are generally not issued by any central authority,
    rendering them theoretically immune to government interference
    or manipulation. [Source: Investopedia]

    This class provides a information about the cryptocurrencies available as
    well as the ability to select specific cryptocurrencies based on the currency.

        Input
        ----
        crypto (string, default is None)

            Whether the crypto needs to be capitalized. By default the values
            always are capitalized as that is also how it is represented in the csv files.
        base_url (string, default is GitHub location)
            The possibility to enter your own location if desired.
