# as_seg: module for computing and segmenting autosimilarity matrices. #

Hello, and welcome on this repository!

This project aims at computing autosimilarity matrices, and segmenting them, which consists of the task of structural segmentation.

The current version contains the CBM algorithm [1], along with a (low-effort) implementation of Foote's novelty algorithm [2].

It can be installed using pip as `pip install as-seg`.

This is a first release, and may contain bug. Comments are welcomed!

## Tutorial notebook ##

A tutorial notebook presenting the most important components of this toolbox is available in the folder "Notebooks".

It is only available if you downloaded the project from git (e.g. https://gitlab.inria.fr/amarmore/autosimilarity_segmentation), and is not available in the pip version (which is in general not accessible easily in the file tree).

## Software version ##

This code was developed with Python 3.8.5, and some external libraries detailed in dependencies.txt. They should be installed automatically if this project is downloaded using pip.

## How to cite ##

You should cite the package `as_seg`, available on HAL (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03797507).
