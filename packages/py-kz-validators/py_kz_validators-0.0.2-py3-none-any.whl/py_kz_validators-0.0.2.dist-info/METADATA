**A collection of Python validators for various Kazakhstani identification numbers, such as the Individual Identification Number (IIN) and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)**

## Installation

```bash
pip install py-kz-validators
```

## Usage

Here are the available validators:

### 1. Individual Identification Number (IIN)

The IIN validator checks whether a given string represents a valid Kazakhstani Individual Identification Number.

```python
from kz.validators import IIN


if IIN.is_valid('791028302728'):
  print('IIN is valid')
else:
  print('IIN is not valid')

```

This code will output `IIN is valid` since the IIN `791028302728` is a valid Kazakhstani Individual Identification Number
