    """
    The ``FlexGraph`` is used to keep track of dependencies and invoke callables.

    When determining dependencies for a callable,  flexdi will examine the type
    annotations of the arguments, and populate the graph with dependencies which
    can satisfy the callable. A callable can be anything from a class (as seen
    with the type annotations), to functions, class methods, generators, etc.

    For complex types, flexdi allows binding helper functions that can map a type
    definition to an instance. These bindings can themselves be injected with
    dependencies. Bindings can also be defined as generators which allows supplying
    custom teardown logic for dependencies.

    When using the FlexGraph directly to resolve dependencies, it must be used as
    an asynchronous context manager. This ensures the proper teardown of any
    dependencies it creates during dependency resolution.

        Bind a provider to a resolve a particular type.

        By default, this method will examine the return type annotations on the
        provided callable to determine what it should resolve. In cases where you
        want to be more specific, you can choose to explicitly list the value type
        that should be resolved.

        For generator and iterator type providers, the generic parameter will be
        pulled out and used to determine the type. i.e.

        * A function returning ``Iterator[T]`` binds to ``T``
        * A function returning ``Generator[T, U, V]`` binds to ``T``
        * A function returning ``AsyncIterator[T]`` binds to ``T``
        * A function returning ``AsyncGenerator[T, U]`` binds to ``T``

        If the binding is set as eager, the provider will be invoked as soon as
        the graph is opened. This is useful for applications which chain the
        graph instance.

        This method can be used as a no-argument decorator, a standard decorator,
        or used as a normal function call. e.g. these are all valid uses:

            def provide_foo() -> Foo:
