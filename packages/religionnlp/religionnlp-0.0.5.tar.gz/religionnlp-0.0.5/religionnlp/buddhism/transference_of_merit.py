    """
Chao Du, also known as Transference of Merit, is a practice in Buddhism that involves dedicating one's good deeds or merits to benefit others, particularly those who have passed away. Some characteristics of Chao Du include:

Compassion: Chao Du is driven by the Buddhist value of compassion, which motivates practitioners to help others, including those who have already died.
Altruism: Chao Du is a selfless act of dedicating one's merits to others without expecting anything in return.
Merit: Chao Du is based on the Buddhist belief that individuals accumulate merits through good deeds, which can then be dedicated to others for their benefit.
Belief: Chao Du is based on the belief in the existence of the afterlife and the possibility of rebirth.
Ceremony: Chao Du is often performed as part of a larger ceremony or ritual, such as a funeral or a memorial service.
