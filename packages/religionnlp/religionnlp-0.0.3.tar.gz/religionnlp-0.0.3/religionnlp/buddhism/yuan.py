class Yuan:
    """
"Yuan" (ç¼˜) is a concept in many religions, including Buddhism and Taoism, which refers to the interconnectedness and interdependence of all things in the universe. It can be understood as the idea that all things arise from causes and conditions, and that nothing exists independently or in isolation. Some characteristics of "yuan" include:

Interconnectedness: "Yuan" emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things, with each thing having an effect on everything else.
Impermanence: "Yuan" recognizes the impermanence of all things, as everything is subject to change and transformation.
Causality: "Yuan" recognizes that everything arises from causes and conditions, and that everything has consequences.
Acceptance: "Yuan" emphasizes acceptance of the present moment and the way things are, rather than trying to resist or control them.
Compassion: "Yuan" emphasizes compassion for all beings, recognizing that everyone is connected and interdependent.
