Too many problems with the experimental Numba class. Converting this
to a series of Numba functions and a Python classes.

Implementation of count-min sketch using Numba. Three different types have been coded,
but all use conservative updating to help reduce errors. The three types are

* linear : Uses 32-bit linear counters
* log16 : Uses 16-bit log counters
* log8 : Uses 8-bit log counters

Each type is implemented as a Python class, but uses numba functions under the hood
where possible (and faster). The convenience function, :code:`CountMin()` is the
recommended way to instantiate a count-min sketch. The Python classes are
:code:`CountMinLinear`, :code:`CountMinLog16`, and :code:`CountMinLog8`.

Example
-------
To get a linear CountMin with width = 2\*\*20 ::

    from sketchnu.countmin import CountMin

    width = 2**20
    cms = CountMin("linear", width)
    key = "testing".encode("utf-8")
    cms.add(key)
    # To get an estimated count for that key use either
    cms.query(key)
    cms[key]

Each count-min sketch implementation has two special counters that are stored in the
attribute :code:`n_added_records` which is a 1-d array with two elements. The first
records the total number of elements added to the count-min sketch. This is useful when
calculating the error guarantees. Its value can be retrieved with :code:`n_added()`.
The second element is used by :code:`helpers.parallel_add()` to store the number of
records added to the sketch. This value is needed when using a count-min sketch to
calculate the tf-idf value for a given record. The idf piece needs the number of
records which have a given key, i.e. document frequency. This can be provided directly
by the count-min sketch. But you also need to know the total number of records. This
value can be retrieved by :code:`n_records()` if you use :code:`helpers.parallel_add()`
to create the count-min sketch.

    Attributes
    ----------
    width : np.uint64
        Width of the 2-d array of counters of the count-min sketch
    depth : np.uint64
        Depth of the 2-d array of counters of the count-min sketch
    max_count : int, optional
        The maximum value we want to count up to for any given key. Default is
        2\*\*32 -1 (4,294,967,295).
    num_reserved : int, optional
        Perform linear counting for values [0, num_reserved]. After that use log
        counters. This gives more precise estimates for the number of times a key
        is seen for counts <= num_reserved. Default is 1023. This must be less than
        65,535 (2\*\*16 - 1).
    shared_memory : bool
        Whether `cms` and `n_added_records` are attached to a shared memory block
    cms : np.uint32[:,:]
        2-d array of the counters. Shape = (depth, width)
    n_added_records : np.uint64[:]
        1-d array that holds two special counters. The first is the number of elements
        that have been added to the sketch. Useful for calculating error limits. The
        second is used by helpers.parallel_add() to keep track of the number of records
        that have been processed. Useful if you want to calculate a TF-IDF.
    base : np.float64
        Calculated base for the log counters. Depends affected by max_count and
        num_reserved.

    Count-min sketch that uses 8-bit log counters with conservative updating.

    Parameters
    ----------
    width : int
        Width of the count-min sketch. Must be non-negative.
    depth : int, optional
        Depth of the count-min sketch. Must be non-negative. Default is 8.
    max_count : int, optional
        The maximum value we want to count up to for any given key. Default is
        2\*\*32 -1 (4,294,967,295).
    num_reserved : int, optional
        Perform linear counting for values [0, num_reserved]. After that use log
        counters. This gives more precise estimates for the number of times a key
        is seen for counts <= num_reserved. Default is 15. This must be less than
        255 (2\*\*8 - 1).
    shared_memory : bool, optional
        If True, then CountMinLinear is placed in shared memory. Needed if
        performing multiprocessing as sketchnu.helpers.parallel_add() does.
        Default is False.

    Attributes
    ----------
    width : np.uint64
        Width of the 2-d array of counters of the count-min sketch
    depth : np.uint64
        Depth of the 2-d array of counters of the count-min sketch
    max_count : int, optional

    shared_memory : bool
        Whether `cms` and `n_added_records` are attached to a shared memory block
    cms : np.uint32[:,:]
        2-d array of the counters. Shape = (depth, width)
    n_added_records : np.uint64[:]
        1-d array that holds two special counters. The first is the number of elements
        that have been added to the sketch. Useful for calculating error limits. The
        second is used by helpers.parallel_add() to keep track of the number of records
        that have been processed. Useful if you want to calculate a TF-IDF.
    base : np.float64
        Calculated base for the log counters. Depends affected by max_count and
        num_reserved.
