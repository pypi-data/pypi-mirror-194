## A minimal Python package that extracts 2D mesh tally results for plotting convenience.

This package is deployed on [xsplot.com](https://www.xsplot.com) as part of the ```openmc_plot``` suite of plotting apps

# Local install

First you will need openmc installed, then you can install this package with pip

```bash
pip install regular_mesh_plotter
```
# Usage

The package can be used from within your own python script to make plots or via a GUI that is also bundled into the package install.

## Python API script usage

See the [examples folder](https://github.com/fusion-energy/regular_mesh_plotter/tree/master/examples) for example scripts

## Graphical User Interface (GUI) usage

After installing run ```openmc_mesh_plotter``` command from the terminal and the GUI should launch in a new browser window.
