    The ``•`` character represents a space.

    Change the indentation to use a multiple of four spaces.

        line), with the indentation of previous lines. The presence
        (or lack) of indent or dedent meta-characters indicate whether
        the indent is appropriate.

          whitespace element.
        - Any increase in indentation may be _up to_ the number of
          indent characters.
        - Any line must be in line with the previous line which had
          the same indent balance at its start.
        - Apart from "whole" indents, a "hanging" indent is possible
          if the line starts in line with either the indent of the
          previous line or if it starts at the same indent as the *last*
          indent meta segment in the previous line.
