Library for LDAP in Python.
It does not provide any IO or concurrency logic as it's designed to be a pure Python implementation that is then used by other libraries.
This follows the [sans-IO](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) paradigm to promote re-usability and have it focus purely on the protocol logic.
Some examples that utilitise this library can be found in [tests/examples](./tests/examples/)
